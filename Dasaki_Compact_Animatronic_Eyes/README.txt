# Summary

Animatronic eyes moved by micro hobby servos. Compact design able to be fitted in a robot head.  
Eyes include a space for a PCB in case you want to add some led lighting.  
Designed by myself from scratch, using Google Sketchup Free. Parts printed in 0.15 layer height, solid infill.  
Metric thread screws and washers are M3. The rest of the screws are recycled.  
Total action range in either pan and tilt axes is 90 degrees (-45 to 45).

Change log:  
11st june 2014 - Pan servo harness updated to ease assembly.

# How I Designed This

Designed with Google Sketchup 8 and a STL export plugin.

# Instructions

Assembly process pictures included in a pdf file.  
Make sure you screw the servos in the mid position (I chose 90 degrees), so you can have the proper range (in my case from 45deg to 135deg).
